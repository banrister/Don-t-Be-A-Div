		<title>About Don't be a Div</title>

	<h1>What is 'Don't be a div'?</h1>
		<p>'Don't be a div' was an idea by two postgraduate students of the University of Sheffield, Chantal and Claire. They were given the opportunity to learn how to code and construct their own website. They hit the drawing board and although were really impressed by the organisation 'CodeFirst: Girls' and the tutorial websites they provided (they have been included in our own best-of compilation lists!), trying to acquire terminology and find similar simpler FAQs at the beginning of the coding process was daunting.</p>

		<h3>'Don't be a div' aims to be a simple and easy to use comfort blanket for the beginner coder.</h3>
